# ASTE 404 — Homework 4

## What I Did
- (a) Applied to GitHub Student Developer Pack
- (b) Completed “Hello World” tutorial (branch → PR → merge)
- (c) Read Atlassian articles; added takeaways to my report
- (d) Configured Git (name/email, default branch = main, macOS keychain)
- (e) Cloned to `/Users/giovannisuarez/aste404/HW4/hello-world`
- (f) Added **ASTE 404 HW 4.pdf**, committed, pushed
- (g) Used an IDE (VS Code) for Git: commit, branch, PR, diff, graph
- (h) Updated README and downloaded ZIP for Brightspace

## How To Reproduce
1. `git clone <HTTPS URL of this repo>`
2. Create a feature branch; edit `README.md`; commit and push
3. Open a Pull Request; review and merge to `main`
4. Keep `main` current: `git pull --rebase origin main`
5. When finished: **Code → Download ZIP** on GitHub and upload to Brightspace
